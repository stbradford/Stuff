The art of the trailer:

I like films, but rarely have time to watch them. So if I've read/seen a good review (my steadfasts were David and Margaret - sad to see them finish up) and watched the trailer/preview that must often suffice. However, a good trailer does not guarantee a good film, and the feeling you are left with after the highly condensed trailer often does not represent the emotional journey (or lack there of) of the film. Indeed, one film often has multiple trailers - to target different target audiences.

So, as recognition of the trailer as a legitimate art form, I will endeavour to rate those I see over the year and categorize them based on the feeling they leave me with. I'll also delve into the back catalogue - that way if I want a quick boost of inspiration I can watch the "Batman Begins" trailer??...OR if I want to feel hopeless despair I could watch the "Dancer in the Dark" trailer...not sure if dogma '95 allows trailers.

I'll also include links for easy viewing,

Anyway,

Enjoy.
